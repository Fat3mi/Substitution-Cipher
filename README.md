# Substitution Cipher in C#

This C# project implements a simple Substitution Cipher, a type of encryption where each letter in the plaintext is replaced with a letter from a shuffled alphabet. This program provides functionalities for both encryption and decryption.

## Features

- **Encrypt and Decrypt:** Encrypt or decrypt messages using a user-defined or randomly generated shuffled alphabet.
- **Shuffled Alphabet Generation:** Automatically generate a shuffled alphabet if the user does not provide one.
- **Validation:** Ensures that the shuffled alphabet provided by the user is valid and contains all letters from A-Z exactly once.
